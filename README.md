OBJECTIVE:
----------

#Vascular disease prediction system aims to predict the users cardio vascular conditions based on scans and given user data.

* Vascular disease prediction analyses the user’s condition by collecting their symptoms and then processing it and then produces what are the diseases that users might have in their body.

* Vascular prediction system gives a clear view of each vascular disease and the effective methods to maintain their body.

* After displaying results, It suggest the specialized doctors that are practicing near the user’s locality and then they may make an appointment

* Vascular disease prediction system may access the hospitals patient records and then use it produce better results if integrated with hospital database management

PROPOSED SYSTEM:
----------------

The vascular disease prediction system is a modern and creative approach to solve the problem of analysing the cardio vascular and other arteries in the human body rather than the pre-existing body scan approach. The main aim is to predict the cardio vascular disease based on the given user data, we can collect the data in three ways either by using an IOT based sensor or by retinal scan of the user or through pre- recorded data that can be entered by the user.

* Existing methods takes much longer time to get scan results.

* People should get into a lab facility or a hospital to get their bodies scanned.
 
* Scanning machines may sometimes be down while in web based vascular prediction systems this may not be the case
